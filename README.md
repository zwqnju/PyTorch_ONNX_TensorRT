# Introduction
The origin project is [RizhaoCai/PyTorch_ONNX_TensorRT](https://github.com/RizhaoCai/PyTorch_ONNX_TensorRT).

But I meet the same issue as [error:create_execution_context](https://github.com/RizhaoCai/PyTorch_ONNX_TensorRT/issues/3), maybe due to my different environment with the original author.

Anyway, in order to fix this issue, I modified a few code lines in the file [pytorch_onnx_trt.ipynb](https://github.com/zwqnju/PyTorch_ONNX_TensorRT/blob/master/pytorch_onnx_trt.ipynb). My version of this file can run correctly. 


# Environment
0. Ubuntu 16.04 x86_64, CUDA 10.0
1. Python 2.7
2. PyTorch 1.2 
3. TensorRT 7.0
